Problems
Given an array C of size N-1 and given that there are numbers from 1 to N with one element missing, the missing number is to be found.

Input:
The first line of input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. For each test case first line contains N(size of 
array). The subsequent line contains N-1 array elements.

Output:
Print the missing number in array.

Constraints:
1 ≤ T ≤ 200
1 ≤ N ≤ 107
1 ≤ C[i] ≤ 107

Example:
Input:
2
5
1 2 3 5
10
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 10

Output:
4
9

Explanation:

Testcase 1: Given array : 1 2 3 5. Missing element is 4.


#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
	int t,n,i,j;
	scanf("%d",&t);
	for (i=0;i<t;i++){
	    scanf("%d",&n);
	    int arr[n-1];
	    for (j=0;j<n-1;j++){
	        scanf("%d",&arr[j]);
	    }
	    int sum1=n*(n+1)/2;
	    int sum2=0;
	    for (j=0;j<n-1;j++){
	        sum2+=arr[j];
	    }
	    printf("%d\n",sum1-sum2);
	}
	return 0;
}
